# Big-Burger-Builder

A full scale app built using ReactJS which allows a user to build a custom Burger.

## What does it do?

The app offers a choice of selectable ingredients with fixed pricing. After the user selects the desired ingredients, they can click start the check out process by clicking a button.

A summary page, displayed within a Modal, is rendered on the screen. It shows the user the ingredients they selected and the total price for the Burger they created. There is also an option to cancel or continue. 

If the user chooses to continue, an SVG image of the Burger is rendered, to allow the user to see what the burger looks like with the selected ingredients, prior to continuing with the check process. The user at this point, again has the option to cancel the order or continue with the checkout process. 

User Authentication is also implemented, which alows the user to keep a history of past orders, which are viewable by clicking on button.
