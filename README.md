#  Big-Burger-Builder 

A full scale app built using ReactJS which allows a user to build a custom Burger. 

The app offers a choice of ingredients with pricing. After the user selects the desired ingredients, they can click a button to start the check out process. 

A summary page in Modal is rendered showing the user the ingredients they selected and the total price the option to cancel or continue. If the user chooses to continue an SVG image of the Burger is rendered with the selected ingredients for the user to confirm to proceed to check out.
